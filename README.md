# Shape Up Your Testing Strategy: Balancing Unit, Integration, and E2E Tests

Are you struggling to figure out the right balance of unit tests, integration tests, and e2e tests in your projects? 
Look no further! This talk aims to make some clarity in the different types of tests and when to use them. We'll explore 
the importance of unit tests (and what a unit really is), and when to rely on broader integration or e2e tests for 
testing the behaviour of bigger chunks of your application. We'll also cover the different test shapes, such as the 
pyramid and trophy, and what kind of development experience they might lead you to.
